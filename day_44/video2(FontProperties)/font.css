    /* Lets say the above is html code given 
     if we set  h1{font-size = 1 em}  it means it is 100% of size of body elemnet which is its parent so if body is 20px then font size will bwe 20px.
     
     or if we  set h1{font size = 2rem} then it will no longer depend on body element rather it will depend on size of root element which is <html>
     </html> so if html has size 30px h1 will have 200% of it means 60px */
